# Contributing extensions

The default extensions are useful for
simple posts (`post.ts` and `mathlified.tex`) and
creating worksheets/exams (`qn.ts` and `qns.ts`).

We think the power of Mathlified comes
from the potential customizations, so we hope you will show off your
customizations on GitHub discussions.

For commonly used content types, we hope to arrive at a "canonical"
structure and implement it as a default extension.
