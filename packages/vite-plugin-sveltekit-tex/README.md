# Mathlified framework via vite-plugin-sveltekit-tex

The Mathlified framework enables the creation of (mathematical) content
from a single codebase. Code in TypeScript (or JavaScript), and get
a website (via SvelteKit) and tex and pdf files generated automatically.

Also does a simple version of the reverse: convert simple tex markup to
a Svelte page.

Powered by Vite, SvelteKit, Mathlifier (via KaTeX) and Mathlifier2.

In alpha and highly experimental: stay tuned...
